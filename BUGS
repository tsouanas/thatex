\hldestize page doesn't work properly with toc's links.
Sometimes the links won't take you anywhere or take you to an off-by-one page.

Fix fonts, especially sizes won't vary \mathit or \dterm in footnotes, etc.

\eolfill doesn't work properly.
It's a dirty hack anyway in need of an elegant solution.

A lot of code repetition (for example the hint sections of exercise, problem,
and codeit), that can be avoided by better metaprogramming macros.

Fix \ifnull behaviour (when used from within a theorem/definition title that
contains math, it breaks.

\beginol and friends misbehave in doublecolumns when near the end of a page.

\text{\emph{..}} in math doesn't print SOME non-ascii letters:
\it inside $$\text{..}$$ changes meaning, as shown by \show\it.
This is because of amstex.tex.

Pagebreak can occur between problem and its hint-status.

Pagebreak can occur right after a section title.

Pagebreak can occur right after an example title.

\footnote won't be printed when in hint.

If a section ends at the very end of a page, next section *might*
begin with some vertical space; it should never do that.

\sourcecode displays extra new line.

\sourcecode can't display some unicode characters, like \nats, etc.

Cannot use \def's with params (in a nice way) within hints, solutions, of exercises, examples, etc.  Weird behaviour.

Blank page at end of book with header of "General index" and page number.
