\hldestize page doesn't work properly with toc's links.
Sometimes the links won't take you anywhere or take you to an off-by-one page.

Fix fonts, especially sizes in math mode.

\eolfill doesn't work properly.
It's a dirty hack anyway in need of an elegant solution.

A lot of code repetition (for example the hint sections of exercise, problem,
and codeit), that can be avoided by better meta programming macros.
