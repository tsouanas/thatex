Fix fonts, especially sizes won't vary \mathit or \dterm in footnotes, etc.

\text{\emph{..}} in math doesn't print SOME non-ascii letters:
\it inside $$\text{..}$$ changes meaning, as shown by \show\it.
This is because of amstex.tex.

\sourcecode can't display some unicode characters, like \nats, etc.

\pdefs should use `*`, not `\pdef`

\pdefs defined on a chapter level seem to be empty-defined on appendices.
