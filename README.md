# ThaTeX

Thanos's TeX macros for books, lecture notes, and exams.

## Installation

Just place the whole `thatex` dir somewhere that TeX will find it, for example:

    ~/texmf/tex/thatex/

## Requirements

Unfortunatelly ThaTeX only works with the XeTeX engine for the time being.
LuaTeX should eventually be supported as well.
